Cherry is a high-level jQuery-lke interface built on top of a selectable
backend (REXML, LibXML, Nokogiri).

Cherry is currently *alpha*-ware. It is under heavy development and is not
ready for production use.

(NOTE: Cherry used to include a data-driven template system. This has been
separated into a it's own project called Jam.)
