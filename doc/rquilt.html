      <p>rQuery Templates are 100% data driven, much like Amrita, and work in same fashion, with
      only a few distinctions. Pure data drive templates are the creme d' la creme of templating.
      One of the most amazing things to see is a whipped-up YAML file fill out a rQuery template. Yum!</p>
